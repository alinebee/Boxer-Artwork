This repository contains the original source files for the
Boxer application's icons and user interface art. The latest

Usage conditions
----------------

This artwork is released under a (deep breath now)

The gist of it is that you're free to use this artwork in your
noncommercial projects so long as you credit me as a source, but
if you use these files in a commercial project then I'd better
see some money.
